Installation Instructions for SAPRFC
------------------------------------

SAPRFC is an extension module for PHP. With SAPRFC is possible
call an SAP R/3 function modules from PHP scripts. On other side
you can also call a PHP functions from ABAP. 

More information, API documetation, examples and newest versions
you can find on http://saprfc.sourceforge.net.

This document doesn't describe how to install PHP, please see
to the PHP documentation for it (http://www.php.net). 

Please, see to PLATFORM file for supported platform, PHP, RFCSDK library
and SAP version.


Quick info:
-----------

SAPRFC is distributed under PHP license with source codes in
tarball saprfc-$VERSION$.tar.gz. 

Under Linux (UNIX) platform two methods for instalation exist:

  a) Rebuild PHP with saprfc extension included
  b) Build saprfc extension as dynamic module without rebuilding PHP
 
Steps for a)

  Extract source tarball to PHP source tree (under ext/ directory)  
and rebuild PHP with commands 

  rm ./configure
  ./buildconf --force
  ./configure --with-saprfc (+ your configuration directives)
  make

Note: Because librfc.a for SAP RFC SDK 6.20 is not compatible with
      glibc 2.3 you must use method b) for installation saprfc 
      extension on glibc 2.3 based Linux distribution (RH AS 3.0, FC3...).

Steps for b)

  Extract source tarball to some directory and build dynamic module
 with commands  

  cd <saprfc dir>
  phpize
  ./configure
  make 
  make install

  Enable saprfc extension editing your php.ini - add line:

 extension=saprfc.so

For Windows platform (NT/2000/XP/2003) you can download binary package 
saprfc-$VERSION$-$PHP_VERSION$.zip. In this package you  find the 
file php_saprfc.dll. Copy this file to your extension directory 
(extension_dir = ) and enable/load saprfc extension in php.ini file 
(extension=php_saprfc.dll).

Requirements:
-------------

      you can download it from http://service.sap.com/swdc under 
      <Support Packages and Patches - My Company's Application Components
      SAP WEB AS - SAP WEB AS 6.20 - SAP RFC SDK>)

Under Win32:
  
    For compilation:

    * PHP sources (http://www.php.net/downloads.php) 
    * PHP win support files (http://www.php.net/extra/win32build.zip)
    * Microsoft Visual C 6.0
    * Non-Unicode SAP RFCSDK 6.20 for your platform (if you are SAP customer
      you can download it from http://service.sap.com/swdc under 
      <Support Packages and Patches - My Company's Application Components
      SAP WEB AS - SAP WEB AS 6.20 - SAP RFC SDK>)


    For installation (from binary package):

    * PHP binaries (http://www.php.net/downloads.php) 
    * librfc32.dll in Windows System directory (or SAPGUI installed) 

Installation steps under UNIX (with rebuilding PHP):
---------------------------------------------------

Preparation:

     Install SAP RFCSDK to a /usr/sap/rfcsdk directory (or /usr/local/rfcsdk, 
/opt/rfcsdk). If you use other directory, you must configure php with option
--with-saprfc=DIR instead of --with-saprfc.

     Extract saprfc  and php sources, for example, to your home
directory:

     $ cd
     $ gunzip -c php-x.y.z.tar.gz | tar xf -
     $ gunzip -c saprfc-$VERSION$.tar.gz | tax xf -

     Install GNU tools, if you haven't installed them.

Compilation:


     $ mkdir ~/php-x.y.z/ext/saprfc
     $ cp ~/saprfc-$VERSION$/* ~/php-x.y.z/ext/saprfc
     $ cd ~/php-x.y.z
     $ rm ./configure
     $ ./buildconf
 --force
     $ ./configure --your_options,    (see PHP install documentation, how to build PHP)
                   --with-saprfc  
     $ make  
     $ make install


Installation steps under UNIX (dynamic module):
-----------------------------------------------

Preparation:

     Extract SAP RFCSDK to the /usr/sap/rfcsdk directory. Check if you have
php-devel package installed on your system.

     Extract saprfc sources, for example, to your home
directory:

     $ cd
     $ gunzip -c saprfc-$VERSION$.tar.gz | tax xf -

     Install GNU tools, if you haven't installed them.

Compilation:

     $ cd saprfc-$VERSION$
     $ phpize
     $ ./configure
     $ make 
     $ make install


Installation steps under Win32:
------------------------------

Installation:

      1) Extract zip file saprfc-$VERSION$-$PHP_VERSION$.zip
      2) Copy php-saprfc.dll to your extensions directory (e.g. C:\PHP\extensions)
      3) Edit php.ini file (in windows system dircetory, e.g. C:\WINNT, C:\WINDOWS)
         and add line: 'extension=php_saprfc.dll'
      4) Copy librfc32.dll (from SAPGUI install CD) to the windows system
         directory or simple install SAPGUI on your machine.

Compilation:

      1) Extract php sources to C:\PHP-x.y.z
      2) Extract php win support files to C:\PHP-x.y.z\win32
      3) Install RFCSDK to C:\PHP-x.y.z\rfcsdk
      4) Copy SAPRFC sources to C:\PHP-x.y.z\ext\saprfc
      5) Copy php4ts.lib or php5ts.lib (from PHP binaries) to C:\PHP-x.y.z\win32
      6) For PHP5 copy saprfc.dsp5 to saprfc.dsp
      6) Open project C:\PHP-x.y.z\ext\saprfc\saprfc.dsp in Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
      7) Under Tools|Option|Directory set path for Include files and for Library files
         (C:\PHP-x.y.z\win32\include; C:\PHP-x.y.z\rfcsdk\include;
          C:\PHP-x.y.z\win32\lib; C:\PHP-x.y.z\rfcsdk\lib)
      8) Set active configuration to "saprfc - Windows_TS" (under Build menu)
      9) Build php_saprfc.dll.
      10) Compiled DLL you find in C:\PHP-x.y.z\Release_TS directory

After installation:
-------------------

  You can use saprfc_test.php script to test if saprfc extension is activate
  and functional. Copy this script to your www directory. If you will see
  login page to SAP R/3, you have extension successfully installed.
  
  If you want to reduce a little bit the complexity of the rfc-library for
  programming, you can use the saprfc class (in saprfc.php), which provides an easy to use 
  programming interface to most of the functionality of the saprfc-extension.
  Calling functions in sap with the saprfc class is straightforward and easy,
  see example in file "example_userlist.php" to retrieve the user-list of an 
  sap-system. If you want to easily execute programs or want to use the rfc-server
  capabilities, you will have to wait for a new saprfc class version.
